                    <blockquote>Browser extensions put millions of users at risk
                      when misusing their elevated privileges. Despite the current practices of semi-automated code
                      vetting, privacy-violating extensions still thrive in the official stores. We propose an
                      approach for tracking contextual flows from browser-specific sensitive sources like cookies,
                      browsing history, bookmarks, and search terms to suspicious network sinks through network
                      requests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by a prototype called CodeX that
                      leverages the power of CodeQL while breaking away from the conservativeness of bug-finding
                      flavors of the traditional CodeQL taint analysis. Applying CodeX to the extensions published on
                      the Chrome Web Store between March 2021 and March 2024 identified 1,588 extensions with risky
                      flows. Manual verification of 339 of those extensions resulted in flagging 212 as
                      privacy-violating, impacting up to 3.6M users.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Modular programming is a core principle in software
                      development, which demands reducing design complexity through independent code modules. A prime
                      example of modular programming is systems offering various services and applications accessible
                      through the web. Their complex nature, heavy dependence on third-party modules, and large user
                      base call for principled approaches to user security and privacy.
                      This thesis focuses on securing web-driven systems, practically targeting Trigger-Action
                      Platforms (TAPs) and browser extensions. Both increasingly popular systems empower users to
                      develop and publish applications that enhance digital lives through smart automation and
                      personalized web browsing, respectively.
                      Our approach to software security and privacy is through the lens
                      of programming-language techniques. We identify vulnerabilities in popular TAP applications
                      and prevent malicious behavior by sandboxing and fine-grained access control. To minimize data
                      access for TAPs with user-configured applications, we also present a construction-by-design
                      paradigm for on-demand data minimization using lazy computation.
                      Besides access control and minimization, we study how sensitive
                      information is processed once access is granted, using information-flow analysis. We identify
                      privacy risks in browser extensions, such as exfiltration of cookies and browsing history over
                      the network. We develop a static analysis framework to track flows from user-sensitive data to
                      network requests in browser extensions. Moreover, we revisit information-flow policies that
                      are not necessarily transitive, supporting coarse-grained policies where security labels are
                      specified at the level of modules. We leverage flow-sensitive type systems to enforce granular
                      security in module-based systems.

                    <blockquote>Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) empower applications
                      (apps) for connecting otherwise unconnected devices and services. The current TAPs like IFTTT
                      require trigger services to push excessive amounts of sensitive data to the TAP regardless of
                      whether the data will be used in the app, at odds with the principle of data minimization.
                      Furthermore, the rich features of modern TAPs, including IFTTT queries to support multiple
                      trigger services and nondeterminism of apps, have been out of the reach of previous data
                      minimization approaches like minTAP. This paper proposes LazyTAP, a new paradigm for
                      fine-grained on-demand data minimization. LazyTAP breaks away from the traditional push-all
                      approach of coarse-grained data over-approximation. Instead, LazyTAP pulls input data on-demand,
                      once it is accessed by the app execution. Thanks to the fine granularity, LazyTAP enables tight
                      minimization that naturally generalizes to support multiple trigger services via queries and is
                      robust with respect to nondeterministic behavior of the apps. We achieve seamlessness for
                      third-party app developers by leveraging laziness to defer computation and proxy objects to load
                      necessary remote data behind the scenes as it becomes needed. We formally establish the
                      correctness of LazyTAP and its minimization properties with respect to both IFTTT and minTAP. We
                      implement and evaluate LazyTAP on app benchmarks showing that on average LazyTAP improves
                      minimization by 95% over IFTTT and by 38% over minTAP, while incurring a tolerable performance
                      overhead.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Modular programming is a key concept in software
                      development where the program consists of code modules that are designed and implemented
                      independently. This approach accelerates the development process and enhances scalability of the
                      final product. Modules, however, are often written by third parties, aggravating security
                      concerns such as stealing confidential information, tampering with sensitive data, and executing
                      malicious code.
                      Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) are concrete
                      examples of employing modular programming. Any user can develop TAP applications by connecting
                      trigger and action services, and publish them on public repositories. In the presence of
                      malicious application makers, users cannot trust applications written by third parties, which
                      can threaten users’ and platform’s security.
                      We present SandTrap, a novel runtime monitor for JavaScript that
                      can be used to securely integrate third-party applications. SandTrap enforces fine-grained
                      access control policies at the levels of module, API, value, and context. We instantiate
                      SandTrap to IFTTT, Zapier, and Node-RED, three popular JavaScript-driven TAPs, and illustrate
                      how it enforces various policies on a set of benchmarks while incurring a tolerable runtime
                      overhead. We also prove soundness and transparency of the monitoring framework on an essential
                      model of Node-RED.
                      Furthermore, nontransitive policies have been recently introduced
                      as a natural fit for coarse-grained information-flow control where labels are specified at the
                      level of modules. The flow relation does not need to be transitive, resulting in nonstandard
                      noninterference and enforcement mechanism. We develop a lattice encoding to prove that
                      nontransitive policies can be reduced to classical transitive policies. We also devise a
                      lightweight program transformation that leverages standard flow-sensitive information-flow
                      analyses to enforce nontransitive policies more permissively.

                    <blockquote>Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) play a vital role in
                      fulfilling the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) by seamlessly connecting otherwise
                      unconnected devices and services. While enabling novel and exciting applications across a
                      variety of services, security and privacy issues must be taken into consideration because TAPs
                      essentially act as persons-in-the-middle between trigger and action services. The issue is
                      further aggravated since the triggers and actions on TAPs are mostly provided by third parties
                      extending the trust beyond the platform providers.
                      Node-RED, an
                      open-source JavaScript-driven TAP, provides the opportunity for users to effortlessly employ
                      and link nodes via a graphical user interface. Being built upon Node.js, third-party
                      developers can extend the platform's functionality through publishing nodes and their wirings,
                      known as flows.
                      This paper proposes an essential model for Node-RED, suitable to
                      reason about nodes and flows, be they benign, vulnerable, or malicious. We expand on attacks
                      discovered in recent work, ranging from exfiltrating data from unsuspecting users to taking
                      over the entire platform by misusing sensitive APIs within nodes. We present a formalization
                      of a runtime monitoring framework for a core language that soundly and transparently enforces
                      fine-grained allowlist policies at module-, API-, value-, and context-level. We introduce the
                      monitoring framework for Node-RED that isolates nodes while permitting them to communicate via
                      well-defined API calls complying with the policy specified for each node.

                    <blockquote>Nontransitive Noninterference (NTNI) and
                      Nontransitive Types (NTT) are a new security condition and enforcement for policies, which in
                      contrast to Denning's classical lattice model, assume no transitivity of the underlying flow
                      relation. Nontransitive security policies are a natural fit for coarse-grained information-flow
                      control where labels are specified at module rather than variable level of granularity.
                      While the nontransitive and transitive policies pursue different
                      goals and have different intuitions, this paper demonstrates that nontransitive
                      noninterference can be in fact reduced to classical transitive noninterference. We develop a
                      power-lattice encoding that establishes a precise relation between NTNI and classical
                      noninterference. Our results make it possible to clearly position the new NTNI
                      characterization with respect to the large body of work on noninterference. Further, we devise
                      a lightweight program transformation that enables us to leverage standard flow-sensitive
                      information-flow analyses to enforce nontransitive policies. We demonstrate several immediate
                      benefits of our approach, both theoretical and practical. First, we improve the permissiveness
                      over (while retaining the soundness of) the nonstandard NTT enforcement. Second, our results
                      naturally generalize to a language with intermediate input and outputs. Finally, we
                      demonstrate the practical benefits by leveraging state-of-the-art flow-sensitive tool JOANA to
                      enforce nontransitive policies for Java programs.

                    <blockquote>Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) seamlessly connect a
                      wide variety of otherwise unconnected devices and services, ranging from IoT devices to cloud
                      services and social networks. TAPs raise critical security and privacy concerns because a TAP is
                      effectively a “person-in-the-middle” between trigger and action services. Third-party code,
                      routinely deployed as “apps” on TAPs, further exacerbates these concerns. This paper focuses on
                      JavaScript-driven TAPs. We show that the popular IFTTT and Zapier platforms and an open-source
                      alternative Node-RED are susceptible to attacks ranging from exfiltrating data from unsuspecting
                      users to taking over the entire platform. We report on the changes by the platforms in response
                      to our findings and present an empirical study to assess the implications for Node-RED.
                      Motivated by the need for a secure yet flexible way to integrate third-party JavaScript apps, we
                      propose SandTrap, a novel JavaScript monitor that securely combines the Node.js vm module with
                      fully structural proxy-based two-sided membranes to enforce fine-grained access control
                      policies. To aid developers, SandTrap includes a policy generation mechanism. We instantiate
                      SandTrap to IFTTT, Zapier, and Node-RED and illustrate on a set of benchmarks how SandTrap
                      enforces a variety of policies while incurring a tolerable runtime overhead.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Secure Multi-Execution (SME) proves to be a
                      successful technique for enforcing noninterference. A security mechanism based on SME schedules
                      and executes multiple copies of a given program, one copy for each security level, and controls
                      the input/output operations of the copies in a certain manner. A main challenge in devising such
                      mechanisms is to achieve precision, which basically stipulates that changes to the executions of
                      secure programs must be as minimal as possible. Although research in this area has yielded
                      interesting results, the proposed mechanisms do not attain an acceptable level of precision even
                      for the security policies that are weakly sensitive to the timing behavior of programs. This
                      paper proposes a sound and highly precise mechanism for a strong timing-sensitive
                      noninterference. Using a specific round-robin-like scheduler, the mechanism indeed arrives at a
                      highest level of precision demanding that the relative order of input/output events from
                      different security levels should be preserved.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Security policies can be categorized as properties
                      and non-properties. Information flow control is one of the important confidentiality and
                      integrity policies. The difference between expressing policies using only one or more than one
                      trace entails several enforcement mechanisms.
                      Two main types of
                      security enforcement mechanisms are static and dynamic. The common feature of static
                      mechanisms is being conservative due to source-code static analysis before the execution. On
                      the other side, runtime monitoring is a well-known technique among dynamic mechanisms.
                      Recently, permissiveness of dynamic techniques for enforcing information flow policies,
                      compared to static analysis, has attracted increasing attention. Hybrid approaches make use
                      of source-code analysis as additional information on other possible executions of the program
                      under the monitor. Security enforcement mechanisms can be measured in terms of soundness,
                      transparency, and precision.
                      In this technical report, we review the notion of security
                      policies and hyperproperties. We study a wide range of enforcement techniques, including
                      static mechanisms, dynamic mechanisms, program rewriting, and hybrid analysis. We also review
                      the characterization of various dynamic mechanisms and runtime monitors (with or without prior
                      knowledge of possible behaviors of the program) in the literature with reference to
                      enforcement paradigms and comparison factors.
